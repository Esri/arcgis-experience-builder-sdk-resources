In a time series of optical imagery or imagery derivatives (for example, NDVI), pixel values can fluctuate for several reasons: 1. Seasonal change -- Pixel value changes reflect changes in vegetation due to seasonal variability of temperature and precipitation. In the Northern Hemisphere, for example, we expect to see higher density of green vegetation in summer compared to winter; 2. Gradual change -- Pixel value changes reflect trends in vegetation or surface water due to climate variability or long-term land management practices. For example, bare soil may gradually increase in area due to long-term decline in precipitation; and 3. Abrupt change -- Pixel value changes reflect land cover changes that occur suddenly due to deforestation, urban development, natural disaster, and so on. The CCDC algorithm identifies all three change types with the primary purpose of identifying abrupt change. Harmonic regression and trend models are fitted to the data to estimate seasonal and gradual change, and sudden deviations from the trend models are indications of abrupt change.<div><br/>The CCDC algorithm was originally designed for Landsat TM, Landsat ETM+ and Landsat OLI data Surface Reflectance or Brightness Temperature data.
