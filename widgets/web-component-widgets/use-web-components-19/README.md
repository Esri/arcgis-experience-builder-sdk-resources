# Use Map Components
This sample demonstrates how to use web component from Maps SDK for JavaScript and Calcite components in Experience Builder 1.19, which is based on React 19.

## How to use the sample
Clone the [sample repo](https://github.com/esri/arcgis-experience-builder-sdk-resources) and copy this widget's folder (within `widgets`) to the `client/your-extensions/widgets` folder of your Experience Builder installation.

## How it works
This widget imports package `calcite-components` and `arcgis-map-components`, and then use the web component like `<arcgis-legend ref={legendRef}></arcgis-legend>`.
