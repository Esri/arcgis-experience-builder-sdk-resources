# Use Coding Components
This sample demonstrates how to use `@arcgis/coding-components` in a widget. This widget works since 1.17. Before the versions of 1.17, widgets need to handle the initialization of the coding components.

## How to use the sample
Clone the [sample repo](https://github.com/esri/arcgis-experience-builder-sdk-resources) and copy this widget's folder (within `widgets`) to the `client/your-extensions/widgets` folder of your Experience Builder installation.

## How it works
This widget imports components from `arcgis-coding-components`, which is an entry in Experience Builder SDK since 1.17. With this entry, multiple widgets that use the `@arcgis/coding-components` can share the same code.
