# Use calcite components widget

This sample demonstrates how to use [Calcite components](https://developers.arcgis.com/calcite-design-system/components/) in a custom widget.

## Reminder before use

Before you use Calcite components, we suggest you review the components in the jimu-ui package. Jimu-ui is the primary component library for the developer edition of ArcGIS Experience Builder, and you may want to use that first because it will keep your custom widgets and themes consistent with the rest of the Experience Builder theme. If you do have a requirement to use Calcite components, this example will help you.

## How to use the sample

* Clone the [sample repo](https://github.com/esri/arcgis-experience-builder-sdk-resources) and copy this widget's folder (within `widgets`) to the `client/your-extensions/widgets` folder of your Experience Builder installation.
* Run `npm i` in the widget root directory (`npm run copy` will also be executed as `postinstall`, it will copy the `calcite-icon` to `src/runtime/assets`)

```json
  "scripts": {
    "postinstall": "npm run copy",
    "copy": "ncp node_modules/@esri/calcite-components/dist/calcite/assets/ ./src/runtime/assets/"
  },
```

## How it works

First, install `@esri/calcite-components`, `@esri/calcite-components-react`, and `ncp` to the widget directory.

```json
  "dependencies": {
    "@esri/calcite-components": "^1.0.0-beta.61",
    "@esri/calcite-components-react": "^0.2.0",
    "ncp": "^2.0.0"
  },
```

Then, `import { applyPolyfills, defineCustomElements } from '@esri/calcite-components/dist/loader'`, and call `applyPolyfills()` to apply the necessary polyfills of `calcite-components`.

After the widget is loaded, call:

```js
defineCustomElements(window, { resourcesUrl: `${folderUrl}/dist/runtime/` })
```

to register the components of `calcite-components` as web components, and specify the resource load directory through the `resourcesUrl`. Now you are free to use the components of `calcite-components` in your widget.

This widget uses this [calcite components example](https://github.com/Esri/calcite-components-examples/tree/master/react) to demonstrate the usage.
