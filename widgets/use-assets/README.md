# Use Assets
This sample demonstrates how to use assets in a widget.

## How to use the sample
Clone the [sample repo](https://github.com/esri/arcgis-experience-builder-sdk-resources) and copy this widget's folder (within `samples/widgets`) to the `client/your-extensions/widgets` folder of your Experience Builder installation. 

## How it works
This widget requires an asset or use `props.context.folderUrl` to load an asset, then use it in an `<Icon>` component or a `<img>` tag.
