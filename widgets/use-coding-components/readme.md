# Use Coding Components
This sample demonstrates how to use `@arcgis/coding-components` in a widget.

## How to use the sample
Clone the [sample repo](https://github.com/esri/arcgis-experience-builder-sdk-resources) and copy this widget's folder (within `widgets`) to the `client/your-extensions/widgets` folder of your Experience Builder installation.

## How it works
This widget loads the coding components from CDN, and uses the component `arcgis-arcade-editor`
