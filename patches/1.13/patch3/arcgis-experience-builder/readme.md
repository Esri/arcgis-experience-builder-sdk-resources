This patch fixes the sign-in issue when the server is run at a subdirectory. (e.g. https://localhost:3001/subfolder)

Steps:

1. [Download](https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-experience-builder-sdk-resources/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) the repository code and unzip it.
2. Browse to the patch directory (`patches/1.13/patch3/arcgis-experience-builder`)
3. Replace the files in the `client` folder with the files in the `client` folder on your Experience Builder installation.
